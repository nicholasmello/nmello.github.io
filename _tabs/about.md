## Introduction

Hi, I'm Nick Mello â€” an Embedded Software Engineer at Collins Aerospace with a
strong foundation in low-level systems, C development, and Linux-based
platforms. I enjoy working close to the metal and building reliable,
maintainable systems that run in constrained environments.

## Academic Background

I graduated from Boise State University with a Bachelor's in Electrical
Engineering, a minor in Applied Mathematics, and a certificate in Security
Systems Hardware. My education and hands-on experience allow me to work
comfortably across the hardware-software boundary.
